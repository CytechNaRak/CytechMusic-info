        <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
        <p>Last updated: December 27, 2025</p>

        <p>Please read these Terms of Service ("Terms", "Terms of Service") carefully before using the Cytech Music
            Discord bot (the "Service") operated by Cytech Music ("us", "we", or "our").</p>

        <h2>1. Acceptance of Terms</h2>
        <p>By accessing or using the Service, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you disagree with any part of the
            terms, then you may not access the Service.</p>

        <h2>2. Usage License</h2>
        <p>Permission is granted to add and use the Cytech Music bot in your Discord servers, subject to the following
            restrictions:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>You may not use the bot for any illegal or unauthorized purpose.</li>
            <li>You may not attempt to exploit, reverse engineer, or compromise the integrity of the bot's code or
                infrastructure.</li>
            <li>You agree not to spam or abuse the bot's commands.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. Availability and Termination</h2>
        <p>We reserve the right to modify, suspend, or discontinue the Service at any time, with or without notice. We

            reason whatsoever, including without limitation if you breach the Terms.</p>

        <h2>4. Content Liability</h2>
